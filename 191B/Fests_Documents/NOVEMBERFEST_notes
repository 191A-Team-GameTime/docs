-Professor Olson was intrigued on user testing.. asked what plans we had for it and how we'd go about it
-Also asked about our biggest obstacles and how we've overcome them
-Professor Kay asked what the main language we used was
-Didn't seem too interested
-Why was it called GameTime (when it's not specific to gaming?)
-Many people didn't know what 'Game Center' on the iPhone was (even iPhone users)
-Is it possible to go beyond Android since iPhone has more casual mobile gamers (no because m2 wants to test the android market)
-It's better to slowly test new features vs test all features at once 
-It'd be cool to draw circles around different groups (similar to google+) to group different people with similar games and such
-Everyone is asking about our biggest challenges
-One professor asked if there is a way to filter the OS stuff?
-Can we get a different interface? Or is the interface always going to be the same. 
-Look into "Humble Bundle" - an app that bundles games together. 
-See how "Play Games" is like on android. It seems very much like GameTime and what they don't have or are doing wrong try fixing that on our app
-Research an app calledZ-launcher that is a full phone home screen system that promotes suggested apps.
-How is recommendations seem different than google play recommendations? 
-It is important to understand rationale behing decisions of sponsors (so you can focus on the important stuff instead of blindly following your sponsors)
-Does recommendations take into account of old games (If you have an older android phone - it shouldn't recommend games that you are unable to download with an old android device)
-What makes people want to use this? How are you going to market your product?
