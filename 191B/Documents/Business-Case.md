## What we are building

The goal of this project, m2GameTime, is to create an Android application that keeps track of applicaton usage from users, geared towards android game applications. The application will be in the style of a “game center” where the user will have the ability and option of tracking their game application data, and viewing what the M2Community has to offer based on their trending data. The two most important characteristics of this application community and social integration. First, we want this application to provide a sense of competitiveness to the gaming community: view what and when your friends are playing, and challenge them to play a game you are playing. The intent is for users are to compare their game playing data to friends and community. This incentive for users to want to reflect on what they and their community are playing will provide our app richer feedback to users of games that are popular or trending in their communities. Also, social medias such as Facebook will be integrated into the app to allow for better interaction and communication between users. We intend to allow users to log into their Facebook accounts to view their gaming profile information. Using Facebook will also allow users to see gaming profiles and scores among their friends as well to build a better gaming connection within their social circles.

## Why we are building it

m2GameTime’s purpose is to connect with friends and community to share and promote gameplay via mobile games. Each user will have a “score” which reflects a combination of hours, achievements, and challenges they have completed. There is no solution on the Android Platform yet that allows users to connect over mobile games. The problem this application is solving is the need to bridge interaction with friends over mobile devices, to share and compare  application usage and gameplay. If implemented correctly, this could be a solution to that problem. The project, as of now, is planned for Android only release. It will use a custom-built SDK for the framework that allows the app to gather metrics about the user. This SDK, is what separates this app from other apps, because it was built in house. GameTime will be the first of its kind on the Android Market.
