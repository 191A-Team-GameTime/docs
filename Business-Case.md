## What we are building

The goal of this project, m2GameTime, is to create an Android application that keeps track of game usage from users. The app will be in the style of a “game center” where there will be scoreboards, achievement lists, and a list of the different games each user has. The two most important characteristics of this app are competition and social integration. First, we want this app to provide a sense of competitiveness to the gaming community. The intent that users are able to compare themselves to other users will encourage them to play for better scores. This incentive for users to want to play against each other allows our app to provide richer feedback to users of games that are popular or trending in their communities. Also, social medias such as Facebook will be integrated into the app to allow for better interaction and communication between users. We intend to allow users to log into their Facebook accounts to view their gaming profile information. Using Facebook will also allow users to see gaming profiles and scores among their friends as well to build a better gaming connection within their social circles.

## Why we are building it

m2GameTime’s purpose is to connect with friends and share/compete via mobile games. Each user will have a “score” which reflects a combination of hours, achievements, and challenges they have completed. There is no solution on the Android Platform yet that allows users to connect over mobile games. The problem it is solving is the need to socialize with friends over mobile devices, to share and compare scores. If implemented correctly, this could be a solution to that problem. The project, as of now, is planned for Android only release. It will use a custom-built SDK for the framework that allows the app to gather metrics about the user. This SDK, is what separates this app from other apps, since it was built in house. GameTime is a better choice for this problem because there simply isn’t one available yet. The newest trend in the mobile app world is to be “social”, and that is what GameTime is setting out to do.
