# Sponsor Meeting 3 & 5: Conference Call 1 + Face-to-Face android bootcamp

### Date: April 29, 2014 &  May 2, 2014
### Time: 1:30pm &  3:30pm
### Location: Donald Bren Hall 

#### Present: Marissa, Ryan, Joshua, Damon

#### Met With: Mike, Jin &  Brad, Scott, Jin

During the conference call on April 29th Jin, Mike and team game time went over UI design requirements and ideas for what should be submitted.

The conversation was primarily just talk about the SDK, us requesting seeing the SDK so that we can examine what it is capable of.  Finally, we were given the SDK.

At this point we realized that everything we had designed feature wise for the SDK was not going to happen.  Nothing lined up.  It was back to the drawing board for us.

After an extensive talk with Professor Ziv and Team Game Time, we decided further information if not an entire re-design was needed in order to maintain motivation within the group and to get the project going.

During the Android boot camp which started on Friday May 2nd, Team game time met with Brad, Scott & Jin momentarily in order to talk about concerns and to share some ideas for Game Time.  After a long discussion the team is back on board with a better idea of what Game Time will do and what is offers its users.
