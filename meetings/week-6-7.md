Our team went to see the m2Catalyst crew on Wednesday May 7, 2014.  The purpose of this meeting was to iron out any and all wrinkles in the expections of this android application we are supposed to make.  Most of this meeting was revisiting previous information about the requirements for the application, but it definitely shed some light on what we could realistically achieve.  This meeting was lead by Brad, the head of the m2AppMonitor SDK, so it definitely felt more productive than our previous meetings.  We decided on a rough schedule for the UI and the features, and were given some sneak peeks into how it is the system works as of right now.

Fast-forward a week or so, to Monday May 12, 2014.  We have a scheduled conference call at 9am, to review the wireframes which we had discussed that I would send to them.  They had recieved the designs and were overall, quite pleased.  There were some changes discussed, and we sorted out the best options for delivering the UI to users for optimal usability for gathering summer analytics and metrics and then decided that Brad would forward us some starting points for the code as well as the m2AppMonitor UI.  We would use this UI to implement our features before redesigning the UI to our tastes.
