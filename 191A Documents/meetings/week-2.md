## Time and place

Offices of M2Catalyst, Aliso Viejo, CA, Fri Apr 11, 10:30 AM

## Communication schedule

We will meet M2Catalyst in person every other Friday at M2Catalyst, time TBD.

We will also email them a report of what we have done in the last week, with relevant links to changes on the working application, every Friday by 2pm.

We will participate in bi-weekly (off-weeks to in-person meetings) conference calls to simulate standup meetings. 

## Project goals

Our goal this quarter is to produce a working, live, "minimum viable" version of M2Catalyst for a soft launch by end of quarter. It should be deployed to the Android Market by June 15 for beta testing.  

## Other notes

We are expected to learn Android Development practices on our own, with Scott and Brad as references. 

Scott will give us login information to the bitBucket that hosts M2Catalyst at our next meeting.
