This "sponsor" meeting was really just email coorespondance as we went over the details of the mockups, reviewed them together with our sponsors, talked about the flow charts, worked with them on edits via email, etc. 
There was plenty of talk about the final presentation, as well. We asked if there was anything we could provide which might help ensure they are the happiest they can be with us given what we have done this quarter. 
All in all, it was a week spent mostly on planning, developing mockups and editing those mockups. We also collected valuable feedback from users, which our sponsors were pleased to hear.
