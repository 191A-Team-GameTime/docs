Thursday, May 22nd, our team had a scheduled conference call wherein we would go over the technologies which Brad & Scott had given
us access to just a day or so prior.  There was a lot of information to parse through so we agreed that a conference call might
be the best way to handle it.  Turns out, even a conference call might not be enough. We scheduled an in-house meeting for our group
to meet with Brad & Scott as to make it easier to show us exactly how to use what they had sent us.  During the few days inbetween
these meetings, we were to download certain softwares and to familiarize ourselves with the example charts and code they had delivered.

Wednesday, May 28th, Joshua and Ryan went in for a meeting with Brad & Scott. A lot of information was covered. Scott went over in great detail
the nuances of Parse, and tried to make sure Ryan and Joshua were comfortable enough with that before moving on. Then, they discussed the application
and the homepage.  Our original designs are being scrapped. Mike wants something entirely different.  So we are to sketch up some different UI
designs for the 3-tab functionality idea he likes. We are to test these UI designs and get some feedback from people for which ones they
prefer in an application design.
