# Sponsor Meeting 2: Conference Call 1

### Date: April 18, 2014
### Time: 8:30 am
### Location: Remote

#### Present: Marissa, Ryan

#### Met With: Mike, Jin

During this brief conference call (approximately 40 minutes long) we established an understanding of timing for our group meetings.  How long we will allow people to show up before starting meetings, and how members should be prompt when calling in for a conference call.  

We went over a list of features to focus on during this beta /soft launch of the Game Time application.  Between our team and the M2Catalyst representatives, we decided on a comprehensive but compact list of features which we believe could be achieved within our application by the June 15th deadline. 

We decided that our in-person meeting next week would be to go over UI designs together.  In preparation for that meeting, our group will provide several mock-up designs for the UI as we would imagine it.
