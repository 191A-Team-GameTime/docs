## Notes: 
After getting more guidance from our sponsors, we have been focused on creating the 3 mockups and finishing up our detailed flow chart. After showing our sponsors the UI design, they were very pleased with what they saw. We just need to make some tiny changes here and there. We are in the midst of showing the mockups to various random people so that we get a feel of which one is best. This is something m2cataylst wants us to do so that during our upcoming meeting, they can see which UI design will best fit what Gametime will be. In the meantime, we are still practicing our final demos and just tying up loose ends in general.
