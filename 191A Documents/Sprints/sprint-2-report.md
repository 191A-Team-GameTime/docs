# Sprint 2 Report

### Project Game Time


## Initial Tasks

+ Get code from M2Catalyst
+ Rework UI to incorporate functions from Conference Call
+ Start work on Feature 1: My Game Data

## Complete Tasks

+ Rework UI to incorporate functions from Conference Call

## Uncompleted Taks

+ Get code from m2catalyst ...*delayed*
+ Start work on Feature 1: My Game Time ...*delayed*


## Notes: 
Getting code from m2Catalyst has been delayed due to some unforseen hiccups on their end.  They are simultaneously trying to publish the SDK for other venues, so it has been difficult for them to customize it for us.
