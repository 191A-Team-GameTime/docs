##Communication Covenant

#Overview
The purpose of this document is to establish basic team roles; outline ways of keeping all members and clients apprised of meeting schedules, deadlines, and outcomes; establish preferred means of communication among team members (as well as between team-members and outside clients); determine a standard time and location for regular meetings; and explicitly state team member guidelines of conduct.

#Meeting Times & Roles
In addition to attending lectures, Team _____ will have meetings, which will take place on:
Wednesdays between 5pm - 8pm in the ICS building at UCI
Tuesdays & Thursdays between 12:30pm -1:10pm at the JavaCity parallel to Donald Bren Hall

With the option of meeting for extended periods of time over weekends in the case of imminent deadlines needing more dedicated work sessions. To ensure productive meetings, the following tasks will be delegated to different members on a rotating basis:

+      Scheduling meetings (including confirming attendance) [before the meeting]
+      Setting meeting agendas [before the meeting]
+      Facilitating meeting discussion (including staying on agenda)  [during the meeting]
+      Communicating meeting notes [after the meeting]

This leaves 1 person “out” of the cycle for each meeting, providing some slack in case of unavoidable absences or unforeseen circumstances. All members are expected to come to meetings on time, prepared, having read the meeting agenda and having thought about the topics that will be discussed in advance.

Addition to this, meetings scheduled with stakeholders will be expected to be attended on a weekly basis. These meetings will be scheduled based on the stakeholders availabilities, and will be assigned to at least 4 of the 5 team members for attendance. Attendance of these stakeholder meetings will be on a rotation in order to accommodate those members of the group whom are unable to attend because of conflicting schedules. 

#Enforcement
In order to enforce that all members attend the meetings, we will be setting up a “pizza” rule for our team. A member of the team will have to provide pizza for the team if any of the following occur:

+      Late/unexcused absence  to a scheduled meeting.
+       Attending a meeting unprepared.
+      Lack of involvement/presence in meetings.

Team members will be held accountable and adhere to the “pizza” rule. 

#Calendar
A group calendar (using the Google Calendar service) detailing deadlines, activities, and events scheduled for Informatics 191A will be maintained by all of the members and used as is necessary. The calendar can be downloaded here, and access to ownership (allowing event addition, modification, and deletion) may be granted upon request. Modifications made to events within 7 days should be accompanied by an email 
to team members advising of changes to imminent events.

#Communication Methods
Email will be the primary method of communication both internally and externally (with the teaching assistant (TA) and the instructor). All members agree to check their corresponding email address listed below at least twice per day (with no more than 12 hours between checks) during the week, and at least once per day during the weekend.

#Internal emails
Internal emails necessitating a reply should indicate so (and from whom a response is needed) in the beginning of the email. Otherwise, emails will be treated as advisories or open, but optional, calls for feedback from anyone with strong feelings on the subject.

#External emails
External emails must be replied to. If the email is simply advisory (not requiring an answer), someone should still acknowledge receipt of the email. If the email requests an answer, the member with the most domain knowledge in that area should reply. In all cases, all members should be cc’d on emails to ensure all members are apprised of questions, concerns, developments, and feedback.

#Telephony
Team members agree to be available by phone in urgent or extreme circumstances. Those with asterisks (*) have indicated an availability via text messaging (SMS).

#File Management
We will use a shared Google Drive folder for all documents. Code will be maintained using a private repository hosted by Github. 

#Team Member Code of Conduct
Team members will engage respectfully and maturely in all communication. This agreement sets the tone for overall expectations of conduct both internally and externally.

#Enforcement
If a team member fails to contribute adequately or fairly to the group assignments or if a member consistently misses meetings (especially without advance notice), the member will be asked to adhere to our “pizza” rule, which is stated above. Repeated or egregious cases will be brought to the attention of the TA and instructor.
