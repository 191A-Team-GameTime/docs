# Sprint 4 Report

### Project Game Time


## Initial Tasks

+ Work on coding the fake UI to design something for our MVP (in the event our sponsors do not get back to us)
+ Create a new mockup UI that incorporates a strong menu page with information
+ Assign tasks the sponsors addressed to us (flow chart, parse, sdk)
+ Get the new updated SDK from sponsors

## Completed Tasks

+ Work on coding the fake UI to design something for our MVP 
+ Create a new mockup UI that incorporates a strong menu page with information 
+ Assign tasks the sponsors addressed to us (flow chart, parse, sdk)

## Uncompleted Taks

+ -Get the new updated SDK from sponsors … *delayed*



## Notes: 

We have received part of M2Catalyst's old SDK, but have yet to receive the new SDK. At this point, we believe our sponsors feel reluctant to share that item with us for whatever reason. In any case, they have provided us with much information to get the ball rolling for us to work hard on our part. We will continue to work on the tasks they have asked us to work on: create a detailed flow chart, work on parse, and get familiar with the SDK…. as well as create various new mockup UI designs that satisfy our sponsors. They seem very adamant about creating a very detailed thought out flow chart in terms of functionality. Everything from logins, to friend requests, to pressing back etc. etc. Everything needs to have a plan. We will continue to work on that.
