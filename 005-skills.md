4. Get better at Java & learn android SDK. Other than that, learn as much as I can about what I need to do
5. 15 hours/week? I'm not really sure. I will learn as much as I need to so that I can contribute as much as I can.
6. Weekdays, an hour or so per day. Should probably allocate the weekends from this point on as it seems there is many things expected from us
7. Library, Community Center at Camino Del Sol, DBH, Home: Camino Del Sol, or wherever my group wants to meet
8. I will look through various tutorials online and try to pick the best one. I will also lean on various group members so that we can look at what we learned and try to work together on everything.
9. We like to do a ton of emailing so that will be our main platform of communication when we are not meeting. Otherwise, we plan on meeting every Wednesday and going over everything that we need to talk about. Not only that, but most of us share the same classes so we plan on becoming more active in seeking out to each other so that at least some of us will be in communication every single day. We will also sit next to each other in class :)
