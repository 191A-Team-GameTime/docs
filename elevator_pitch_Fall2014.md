How many of you have games on your phone? 

Imagine this scenario. You've been playing Candy Crush for days on end. You haven't eaten, showered, or used the bathroom without your phone by your side. You reached level 382 in this short span of time, but you forgot one thing. You didn't keep track of how long you were playing! Because that is really important information! However, don't fear, GameTime has a solution for you. 

GameTime is an Android based application that tracks data from games on your mobile device. Data such as run time, battery life expended, and bandwith used. In addition to tracking game data about yourself, you can also check out statistics about your friends and people in your community. Compare high scores, download popular games, or see how long your friends really spend on their phone.

GameTime takes the experience from your games and expands it to a friendly environment for your friends and community.
