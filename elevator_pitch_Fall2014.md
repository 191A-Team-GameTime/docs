What can your phone tell you about yourself?
What can it tell you about your friends and family? It can probably tell you who you like to talk to the most, or what you enjoy doing in your spare time. Pieces of yourself can be viewed through the lens of your mobile device, and GameTime can help you take a look. 

GameTime is an Android based application giving you the ability to track and view data usage from games and applications on your phone. With GameTime, you can completetly customize your experience by picking and choosing which applications you want to track, it isn't exclusive to just games. You can view specific application runtime or battery usage, or view all running applications to get a fuller picture at your mobile 'footprint'. In addition to tracking data about yourself, you can also check out statistics from your friends and the people in your community. Compare high scores, download popular games, or see how long your friends really spend on their phone.

GameTime takes the mobile gaming and interactive experience from beyond your phone to create a friendly enviornment for friends, family and community.
